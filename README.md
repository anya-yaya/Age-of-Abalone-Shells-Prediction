# Age-of-Abalone-Shells-Prediction
Predicts the age of abalones from physical measurements using machine learning models.

This project predicts the age of abalone shells based on physical attributes such as length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and sex. Using machine learning techniques, the model estimates the number of rings, which corresponds to the abaloneâ€™s age. The repository includes: <br>
  - Data preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical features, and normalization. <br>
  - Model training: Implementation of regression models for age prediction. <br>
  - Evaluation: Performance metrics, visualizations, and analysis.

This project demonstrates practical application of supervised learning and regression techniques in biological data analysis.
